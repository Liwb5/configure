## Environment Configuration 

This is my work environment configuration in Linux.


### usage

Clone this repository, and run the below command:

```
sh install_env.sh /your/home/path all
```

`/your/home/path` is your `HOME` directory.

NOTE: If you want to use `oh my zsh`, refer [this](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).
